***** = Priority (1 start = less priority)

****Figure out how to handle submissions with absolute file paths specified

*****Give feedback to user in some sort of receipt
	This will help when searching logs, can just grep for receipt

**Give TAs power to access prelabs, but nothing else
	Script to fetch them

**Give TAs power to fetch their own lab sections once headTA authorizes
	Will require some thought

Modularize submit command
	Have all CS2050 requirements in a script, all CS1050 reqs in script, etc
	Have submit run those scripts and wait for response before submitting
	This allows for easy integration with other classes if desired

Figure out a way to test for memory leaks on submit
	You'd have to parse through valgrind output....ew

Automate change of dates (and change of assignment keys?)
	JEREMY WHY

Automate archive of logs

Make better logs?

Get purge through to /home/submissions

*****Figure out how to handle zip file submissions (for makefiles - CS2050)

*****************Create symlinks for headTAs on the /home/submissions dir
