Instructions for those who might be managing this active system

READ THE DAMN README


There's a TODO.txt file that lists things you can add onto the submission system. 
Add to it as you see fit.

I'm working on permissions for you guys, so for now you can't really do anything.

If you are going to change stuff with the scripts, DO SO IN THE DEV VERSION OF SUBMIT.
DO NOT MOVE THE SUBMIT SCRIPT TO /usr/local/bin UNTIL YOU'VE TESTED IT AND HAVE 
GOTTEN ALL UPDATES FROM THE REPO OR YOU MIGHT BREAK THINGS. 

Then you have 300 students yelling at you about breaking things.

And that sucks.


Also, only Andrew and Daniel can push the dev submit into the current submit script
for students to use, because they're head TAs. This will change if someone else
should be designated as "head TA". 

Above is also true for most of the scripts involving modifications to /home/submissions.
